## Takeaways and Future Development
This was my first introduction to SQL, so learning how to incorporate that into dynamic queries prompted by user input has stretched my comfort zone.  Below are next steps to expand on the application's functionality.  

- Adding the ability to edit employee role information in case of promotion
- Adding the ability to delete employees from database in the event of termination or resignation
- View departments by budget and set limits on number of roles/employees that can be hired/entered into the system
