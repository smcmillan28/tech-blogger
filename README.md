## Takeaways and Future Development
Using Handlebars as HTML templates allows for easy site navigation and gave access to database tables and information, which was a lot easier than using static HTML and the file system.  Sequelize continues to make MySQL integration into JavaScript applications a whole lot easier.  Steps for future development listed below:

- Adding the ability for users to comment on posts
- Adding the ability for users to delete those comments
- Adding the ability for users to edit their posts
- Adding the ability for users to like/dislike posts (upvote system similar to reddit)
